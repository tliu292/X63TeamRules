# X-Team 63 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will all get together and read the program together and evenlly split up the tasks.
We will split up the tasks evenlly so that everyone contributes and so that one person doesn't do all the work.
If someone doesn't know how to complete their task, we can all pitch in and try to help out and reassign if necessary.
If someone knows how to do the task, they can help to teach everyone else so that we all learn.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will make sure to communicate well with one another and check up each others progress to see if anyone needs help.
We will also make sure to meet together once a week or more if necessary in the CS building to inform each other on progress 
or what needs more work.
If we face difficulties we can either message in our FB group chat or post in the "Issues" section on github to alert other 
members that help is needed or changes need to be made.
